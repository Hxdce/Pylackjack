# Pylackjack, a.k.a. Python Blackjack.

Created by Hxdce in early(?) 2018.

NOTE: This project is really old and has a lot of beginner code.

&nbsp;

Tools used: PyCharm, Aseprite

Card sprites are originally from Windows 3.0/95/98. Credits to Microsoft for them.

Features a custom made retro interface that matches the retro card sprites!

Uses Python 3 and Pygame. Simply launch "Pylackjack.py" to play.
Also included is a CLI version of the game!
